Taxation Problem:

Tax Calculator Problem
GlobalNext Solutions, a rapidly growing IT company, employs a diverse workforce ranging from entry-
level developers to senior executives. The HR department wants to streamline the tax calculation
process for employees under the New Tax Regime (2023). They’ve decided to build a tax calculation
program that computes salaries, taxes, and net incomes while ensuring compliance with the latest tax
laws.
As a software developer in GlobalNext’s HR-Tech team, you are tasked with developing this program.
The system should process employee salary details, validate inputs, calculate taxes, and generate
detailed reports.
The program should:
1. Accept employee details, including monthly salary components.
2. Calculate gross and taxable income according to the New Tax Regime (2023).
3. Compute the tax payable using the appropriate tax slabs.
4. Apply any applicable standard deductions and rebates.
5. Generate reports detailing gross salary, taxable income, tax payable, and net salary.
Level 1: Basic Input and Salary Calculation
Objective: Capture employee details and calculate the gross salary.
Tasks:
• Accept the following inputs for an employee:
o Name
o EmpID
o Basic Monthly Salary
o Special Allowances (Monthly)
o Bonus Percentage (Annual Bonus as % of Gross Salary)
• Calculate:
o Gross Monthly Salary = Basic Salary + Special Allowances
o Annual Gross Salary = (Gross Monthly Salary × 12) + Bonus
• Output:
o Display the employee details, gross monthly salary, and annual gross salary.

Level2:
Level 2: Taxable Income Calculation
Objective: Calculate taxable income after standard deductions.
Tasks:
• Deduct a Standard Deduction of ₹50,000 from the annual gross salary.
• Compute the Taxable Income and display all intermediate calculations.
Output: Display gross salary, standard deduction and taxable income.

Level 3: Tax and Rebate Calculation
Objective: Compute tax payable using the New Tax Regime (2023) slabs.
Tasks:
1. Calculate tax based on the following slabs:
o ₹0 - ₹3,00,000: 0%
o ₹3,00,001 - ₹6,00,000: 5%
o ₹6,00,001 - ₹9,00,000: 10%
o ₹9,00,001 - ₹12,00,000: 15%
o ₹12,00,001 - ₹15,00,000: 20%
o Above ₹15,00,000: 30%
2. Apply Section 87A Rebate:
o Taxable income ≤ ₹7,00,000 → 100% rebate (tax payable = ₹0).
3. Add a 4% Health and Education Cess to the calculated tax.
Output:
• Display a detailed tax breakdown, including slabs, cess, and total tax payable.
----------------------------------------
Level 4: Net Salary Calculation
Objective: Calculate annual net salary after tax deductions.
Tasks:
1. Compute Net Salary = Annual Gross Salary - Total Tax Payable.
2. Display:
o Annual Gross Salary
o Total Tax Payable (including cess)
o Annual Net Salary
--------------------
Level 5: Report Generation
Objective: Generate a detailed report for employees.
Tasks:
1. Summarize all computed details:
o Employee Details (Name, EmpID)
o Gross Monthly Salary
o Annual Gross Salary
o Taxable Income
o Tax Payable (with breakdown)
o Annual Net Salary
2. Format the output as a report for better readability.

python docs
microsoft have given wonderful documentation


can we modify a list which is an element in the tuple

we want to pass command line arguments into the my range function 

why and for where ands what purpose in argv we need the file name 

why in python there is npo implicit typecasting
sum = 'abc' + 55
is a type error we can concatenate only a string to string not a number to a string


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 4

how to read input  in python till will give 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 5 

why there is no index error in the case of slicing

implement a function find (similar to find method in class) which mimics the find method of string class

why the value is zero in mysuru string if we find m its 0 and if we are finding empty set then ALSO IT IS ZERO
